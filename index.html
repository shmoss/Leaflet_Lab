				<p> Since the 1970's, liberal trade policies have drained cities of their manufacturing sector.  The Midwest was particularly hard-hit, and is now called the "Rustbelt" - which refers to the region's stagnant economy following the outsourcing of industry.  With unemployment on the rise, Midwestern cities have seen an increase in homicide rates. <br><br> This interactive map depicts annual homicide totals (2001-2013) for the 15 largest Midwestern cities.  Homicides are represented in two ways: a rate per 100,000 people and raw totals.<br><br>Different insights can be drawn from toggling between "normalized" (homicides per 100,000 people) and "raw" (total homicides). For example, viewing raw homicides might give the impression that Chicago is much more dangerous than it really is.  Viewing the same data normalized by a city's population may change this assumption.<br><br>This data was obtained from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/crime">City Data</a> and is public domain.
