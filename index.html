				</p><b>Can different representations of homicide lead to alternative conclusions?</b>
				</p>
				<p> Since the 1970's, liberal trade policies have drained cities of their manufacturing sector.  Midwestern cities were particularly hard-hit, and are now called the "Rustbelt" due to their stagnant economy and loss of jobs.  With unemployment on the rise, many Midwestern cities face urban blight and increasing crime rates.<br><br> Though crime rates are generally lower today than they were in the 1980's and 1990's, crime in major cities still fluctuates year by year.  This interactive map depicts annual homicide totals (2001-2013) for the 15 largest Midwestern cities.  Homicides are represented in two ways: a rate per 100,000 people and raw totals.<br><br>Different insights can be drawn from toggling between "normalized" (homicides per 100,000 people) and "raw" (total homicides). For example, viewing raw homicides gives the impression that Chicago is much more dangerous than it really is.  Viewing the same data normalized by a city's population may change this assumption.<br><br>This data was obtained from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/crime">City Data</a> and is public domain.
